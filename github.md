## Why use Github
The beauty of Git and Github is collaboration and version control.
- Use this to track the history of a project
- Allows multiple people to work on the same project at once

### Git vs. Github

- Git
	- The actual version control software
- Github
	- Web service for git projects
	- Like a social media for a git project

## Key Terms

- Repository
	- Repo for short
	- This is where you will be storing everything for the project
- Commit
	- Think of this like saving
	- Add messages to your commits to explain what you're committing
	- You can browse the history of each commit and see what was changed
- Branches
	- Can create different code bases within your repo
	- Think of it almost as a different save as of a whole repo
- Merge
	- One branch absorbs another branch
- Fork
	- Like taking a whole repo, and creating a new instance of that under your own account
	- You now will have an exact replica of that repo, including it's history
	- We can then make as many changes as we want without affecting the original repo
- Pull Request
	- If I'm happy with what I've been working on, I could create a pull request to the original repo
	- This would mean I want to add my code to the original repo
	- Then the owner of the original repo can decide whether they want to pull my changes or not
